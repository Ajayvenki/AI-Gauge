## 🌍 Carbon Tracking: Your AI's Environmental Impact

**Think of AI-Gauge as a "carbon mileage tracker" for your code.**

Just like how fuel efficiency apps help reduce car emissions, AI-Gauge shows you the environmental cost of your AI decisions:

- **GPT-4 API Call**: ~0.5g CO2 (equivalent to driving 1 meter)
- **GPT-3.5 API Call**: ~0.05g CO2 (90% less emissions)
- **Local Model**: ~0.001g CO2 (99.8% less emissions)

**Small changes, big impact. Your AI usage has a carbon footprint - AI-Gauge helps you minimize it.**
