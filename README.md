# 🤔 AI-Gauge: Smart AI Cost Optimization

> **Have you ever wondered if your model choice is actually appropriate for the task?** 💭
>
> You're pouring money into GPT-4 for simple text corrections, or burning through tokens on tasks that could run perfectly on GPT-3.5. Meanwhile, your AI usage is quietly contributing to carbon emissions. What if you could get intelligent recommendations *before* making the API call?

AI-Gauge is a VS Code extension that automatically analyzes your LLM API calls and recommends the most cost-effective models **before execution**. Save 60-70% on AI costs while maintaining performance and reducing your carbon footprint. 🌱

## 🚨 The Problem

AI API costs are spiraling out of control. Organizations spend thousands monthly on over-provisioned models, with no visibility into which calls are truly necessary. Traditional monitoring tools only show costs **after** the fact - by then it's too late. 💸

## ⚡ The Solution

AI-Gauge intercepts your API calls **before** they execute, analyzing task complexity with a local AI model to recommend the optimal model. Get cost and carbon estimates upfront, not as a surprise bill. 🎯

### ✨ Key Benefits
- **💰 60-70% Cost Savings**: Automatically switch to appropriate models
- **🌱 Carbon Reduction**: Track and minimize AI's environmental impact
- **🚀 Zero Configuration**: Install and start saving immediately
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All analysis happens locally on your machine

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **🎣 Intercept**: Catches LLM API calls in real-time as you code
2. **🧠 Analyze**: Uses local AI to assess task complexity and requirements
3. **💡 Recommend**: Suggests the most efficient model with cost/carbon estimates
4. **✅ Execute**: You decide whether to proceed with the recommendation

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **📦 Install** from VS Code Marketplace: Search "AI-Gauge"
2. **⚙️ Setup**: The extension automatically sets up Ollama and downloads the analysis model
3. **💻 Code**: Start coding - get inline recommendations for every API call

## 📊 Real Impact

**🏢 Mid-size SaaS Company Case Study:**
- **Before**: $15K/month on GPT-4 calls
- **After**: $4.5K/month (70% savings) 💸➡️💰
- **Performance**: 98% task success rate maintained ✅
- **Carbon**: 12 tons CO₂ equivalent saved annually 🌍
